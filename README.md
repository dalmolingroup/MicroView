MicroView, a reporting tool for taxonomic classification

MicroView agreggates reports from taxonomic classification tools,
such as Kaiju and Kraken.

You can provide either a path to results
in the -t argument or, with -df, a path to a 2-column CSV file,
the first column sample paths and the second containing group names
or contrasts.
